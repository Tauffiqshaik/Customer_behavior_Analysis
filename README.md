# Customer_behavior_Analysis
Data Analysis Project Showcasing for Custom Behavior Analysis using Python,SQL and PowerBi



# 📊 Data Analytics Project – End-to-End Analysis & Dashboard

 # Overview

This project demonstrates an **end-to-end data analytics workflow**, covering data loading, exploratory data analysis (EDA), data cleaning, SQL-based analysis, and business intelligence visualization.
The goal is to extract meaningful insights from raw data and present them through an **interactive Power BI dashboard**, a **written report**, and a **professional presentation**.

# 📂 Dataset

* Contains customer and transaction-related data
* Includes demographic, behavioral, and purchase attributes
* Source: CSV file (can be replaced with any structured dataset)

**Key attributes:**

* Customer details (age, subscription status, etc.)
* Purchase history
* Discount and transaction information

# 🛠 Tools & Technologies

* **Python** – Data loading, cleaning, and EDA

  * Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
* **SQL** – Data querying and aggregation


# 🔄 Project Workflow / Steps

# 1️⃣ Data Loading (Python)

* Imported CSV dataset using Pandas
* Checked data shape, column types, and basic statistics

#2️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

* Analyzed distributions and trends
* Identified missing values and outliers
* Visualized key variables using charts

#3️⃣ Data Cleaning

* Handled missing and inconsistent values
* Standardized column formats
* Created derived features (e.g., age groups, customer segments)

#4️⃣ SQL Analysis

* Loaded cleaned data into a relational database
* Wrote SQL queries using:

  * `CASE WHEN` for categorization
  * `GROUP BY` and aggregations
  * `COALESCE` to handle NULL values
* Extracted insights on customer behavior and purchases

# 5️⃣ Dashboard Development (Power BI)

* Connected Power BI to the database
* Built interactive visuals:

  * KPIs
  * Bar charts
  * Pie charts
  * Filters and slicers
* Designed a clean and business-friendly layout

#6️⃣ Reporting & Presentation

* Created a detailed analytical report
* Designed a professional presentation using **Gamma**
* Summarized insights and business recommendations

# 📊 Dashboard Highlights

* Customer segmentation by age and behavior
* Purchase trends and discount impact
* Identification of high-value and loyal customers
* Interactive filters for deeper analysis

# 📈 Key Results & Insights

* Clear customer segmentation improves targeted strategies
* Loyal customers show higher engagement and response to discounts
* Certain age groups contribute significantly to revenue
* Dashboards enable faster, data-driven decision-making


## ▶️ How to Run This Project

### Python & EDA
